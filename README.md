## Introduction


Things to keep in mind during the class:


* What is being modeled as random?

* From where does the randomness arise?

* From where does the systematic model components arise?

* [...]









### Experiments


For a given experiments:

* attribute all that is known or theorized to the systematic model

* attribute everything else to randomness

* use probability to quantify uncertainity in your conclusions

* evaluate the sensitivity of your conclusions to the assumptions of your model


### Set notation


### Probability

A **probability measure** is a function $P: \Omega \mapsto \mathbb{R}_{[0,1]}$



### Random variables




### PMFs and PDFs





### CDFs, survival functions and quantiles
